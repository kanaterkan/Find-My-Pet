# User stories

User <br>
As a user, I want to create an account with my contact information, to save my contact credentials. <br>
As a user, I want to upload a photo of my lost pet, so that other can help me find it.  <br>
As a user, I want to share the last seen location of my lost pet, so that others in the region can help me find it.  <br>
As a user, I want to receive push notifications when a lost pet is reported, so I can help with the search. <br>
As a user, I want to view listings of missing pets in my area, to potentially recognize and return them. <br>
As a user, I want to delete my post, so nobody continues searching for my pet, after it has been found and returned. <br>
